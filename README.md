## About
Lucid Diffusion was originally a personal notebook offshoot of Disco Diffusion V5.6 to practice python, but having added some interesting features, I thought it best to release it to the public. This fork restructures the Google Colab notebook and the python code in a way that is a bit more organized for the end user:
* init_images includes new features and is now found in the ideation section.
* Google Colab GUI to enter your prompt
* And more...
